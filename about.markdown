I love learning new things, programming, and cooking waffles. I strive to uncover new ways to make life better for friends, co-workers, and family. I live in Utah and my main interests are in data science and robotics. What else is there to know? Feel free to reach out for consulting or pro bono help if it is for a good cause.
